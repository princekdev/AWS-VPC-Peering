# 🌐 AWS VPC Peering Project

This project demonstrates how to set up **secure communication between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** using **AWS VPC Peering**. As a DevOps learner, this helped me understand cloud networking, routing, and AWS infrastructure cost management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ Created two VPCs (`Prod-VPC` and `Test-VPC`) in different CIDR ranges
- ✅ Launched EC2 instances in each VPC (public & private subnets)
- ✅ Enabled communication using **VPC Peering**
- ✅ Configured route tables and security groups
- ✅ Set up **NAT Gateway** for private subnet internet access
- ✅ Monitored **AWS Billing & Cost Explorer**
- ✅ Documented the learning and architecture clearly

## 🚀 AWS Services Used

| Service           | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **VPC**          | Create isolated cloud networks               |
| **EC2**          | Launch test instances                        |
| **VPC Peering**  | Enable cross-VPC communication               |
| **NAT Gateway**  | Allow private subnets to access internet     |
| **Elastic IP**   | Used for NAT Gateway                         |
| **Security Groups** | Control inbound/outbound traffic         |
| **Route Tables** | Define traffic routing between VPCs          |
| **Cost Explorer**| Track and analyze project costs              |
